# Adult Content Platforms Fix

## Problem
The adult content platforms (Pornhub, XVideos, XHamster, YouPorn, SpankBang, RedGifs) were getting **404 Not Found** errors when trying to download videos.

## Root Cause
The adult content platforms were configured to use the **generic `{platform}` endpoint** (`/api/download/{platform}`), but there was a **routing issue** where the generic route wasn't being matched properly.

## Solution
Added **specific endpoints** for each adult content platform, following the same pattern as YouTube, TikTok, etc.

### Backend Changes
Added specific endpoints in `GetYoVids-backend/Controllers/DownloadController.cs`:

```csharp
[HttpPost("pornhub")]
public async Task<IActionResult> DownloadPornhub([FromBody] DownloadRequest request)

[HttpPost("xvideos")]
public async Task<IActionResult> DownloadXVideos([FromBody] DownloadRequest request)

[HttpPost("xhamster")]
public async Task<IActionResult> DownloadXHamster([FromBody] DownloadRequest request)

[HttpPost("youporn")]
public async Task<IActionResult> DownloadYouPorn([FromBody] DownloadRequest request)

[HttpPost("spankbang")]
public async Task<IActionResult> DownloadSpankBang([FromBody] DownloadRequest request)

[HttpPost("redgifs")]
public async Task<IActionResult> DownloadRedGifs([FromBody] DownloadRequest request)
```

### How It Works
1. **URL Validation**: Each endpoint validates that the URL is from the correct platform
2. **Unified Processing**: All endpoints call `DownloadFromPlatform(platform, request)` 
3. **Platform-Specific Logic**: The `DownloadFromPlatform` method contains platform-specific yt-dlp arguments
4. **File Stream Response**: All platforms return file blobs (unified contract)

### Platform-Specific Features
- **Pornhub**: Special cookie handling for authentication
- **All Platforms**: Anti-blocking arguments (`--force-ipv4`, `--no-check-certificate`)
- **All Platforms**: 1080p quality limit with format selection
- **All Platforms**: 30-minute timeout (same as YouTube)

## Testing
Use the `test-adult-platforms.js` script to verify all platforms work:

```javascript
// Run in browser console
// Tests all adult platforms and reports success/error status
```

## Benefits
✅ **No more 404 errors** - All platforms have specific endpoints  
✅ **Unified contract** - All platforms return file blobs  
✅ **Same timeout settings** - 30 minutes for all platforms  
✅ **Platform validation** - Each endpoint validates correct URLs  
✅ **Consistent experience** - Same frontend logic for all platforms  

## Deployment
After making these changes, **redeploy the backend** to your VPS:

```bash
# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop characterforge-imagix

# Deploy new code
# (your deployment process)

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start characterforge-imagix

# Check status
sudo systemctl status characterforge-imagix
```

## Status
- ✅ **Backend**: Fixed with specific endpoints
- ✅ **Frontend**: Already configured correctly
- ✅ **Testing**: Scripts available for verification
- ⏳ **Deployment**: Needs to be deployed to VPS
